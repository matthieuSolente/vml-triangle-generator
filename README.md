# vml-triangle-generator
A **generator** to create **isoceles** or scalene triangle** in **email**


Here is a **vml triangle generator** to use in **email**. This generator provides the html and vml code needed to display a triangle in an email. The generated code must therefore be copied and reported in an email, it is functional and has been tested on more than 80 clients/email media. It cannot take into account the multitude of possible scenarios for the use of a triangle. It is up to the integrator to add a background color to the block, if it is to be integrated as a scalene triangle as a separator in an email. It is also up to the integrator to correctly place this code inside a table, cell or div. Because the ways of coding are disparate, the tool cannot predict in what context this code will be used. With knowledge of absolute positioning, the generated code can be of great use in creating original layouts.
You'll also have to define your css rule to make it responsive.
